# Description

This is simulation developed for the CPF of multiple Medusa underwater autonomous vehicles (AUVs) at IST Lisbon. The simulation is set for 3 vehicles but there is no limit on the number of vehicles used. This thanks to the fact that the CPF algorithm is implemented in a distributed fashion.  

# Installation (for the Simulation package)

- run initialization_3vehicles.m
- run Real_three_Medusa_CPF_Event_Communication_For_Test
- run resample_3vehicles.m
- run animation_3vehicles.m
